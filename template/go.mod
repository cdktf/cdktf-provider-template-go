// Deprecated: HashiCorp is no longer publishing new versions of the prebuilt provider for template.
// Previously-published versions of this prebuilt provider will still continue to be available as installable Go modules,
// but these will not be compatible with newer versions of CDK for Terraform and are not eligible for commercial support.
// You can continue to use the template provider in your CDK for Terraform projects with newer versions of CDKTF,
// but you will need to generate the bindings locally. See https://cdk.tf/imports for details.
